This project was an attempt to recreate the google homepage complete with search bar logo etc. 

I was able to learn a lot through googling. This was a good excersise in using containers within containers to create size and orientation consistency. Also it allowed me to better use CSS to get different elements to look and feel how I wanted by using classes, IDs, and element wide rules. 

Overall I was probably too reliant on viewing the page in my browser to see the changes real time. 

Googling was incredibly helpful. It was actually easy to find other people who were having similar issues to me and use suggestions from the community to accomplish what I was trying to do!
